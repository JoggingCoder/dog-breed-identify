# Dog Breed Identification
Dog Breed Identification using Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2.

## Inspiration
You might not be a dog person, so you might not know a lot of dog breeds, but you are a human and you will definately at some point look at a dog and feel aww that is a real nice dog. I wonder what breed it is?

In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.

To do this, we'll be using data from one of the competition, Dog breed identification competition on kaggle. It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

This is a multi-class image classification as we're trying to classify mutliple different breeds of dog.
